# Concordia CLIPS
Concordia game programed in CLIPS.

The file 'Concordia_game.clp' has the classes, facts, instances and rules so that the program plays with 5 players. Because of how its made the game ends by using all the cards, and thats what the players do.

The file 'Concordia_game_v2.clp' has the same code as the one before but trys to give somewhat of a strategy, but because of how its made the players get stuck. With less players I guess it could end.

Note this is a university project, this implies that we had restrictions in the implementation, for example not being able to use switch, if, or create our own functions in CLIPS which would have made the code much more simple and possibly easier to make the game work properly.

PS: the comments and names are in Spanish, sorry for any trouble this could cause.
